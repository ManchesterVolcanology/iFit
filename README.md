# iFit

iFit is a program designed to retrieve SO2 column densities from scattered UV sunlight spectra, with the focus of measuring the SO2 flux from volcanoes. It also allows control of Ocean Optics USB series spectrometers, with simultaneous fitting.

## In Progress
This is version 3.0 and is still in progress. Currently only post analysis is coded, but real time analysis with Ocean Optics spectrometer control is being added.

This update required a significant rewrite of the iFit software but should make it more user friendly and flexible for future applications.
